## Disclainer
This code has been developped for fun, as a Proof of Concept and it doesnÂ´t comply with the ToS of the KrakPlace. 
**We do not encourage anyone to use this bot.**

## Front end
An HTML JS form to send all the data with a graphical interface.
You need to provide :
- The image file to be drawn
- The X and Y coordinates of the to left corner of the drawing
- The size expected for your drawing

The cookies that are being used by the bot must be specified in a `cookie.json` file using the following structure :
```json
{
    "cookies": [
        "cookie1",
        "cookie2",
        "cookie3",
        ...
    ]
}
```
The bot can use multiple cookies in order to reduce the cooldown effect on the bot. The cooldown seen by the bot is then `10s/nbCookies`.

## Backend
A Node JS app using express to forward the API requests to the API of KrakPlace, and bypass the CORS Same Origin policy.
It also handles the routing to the front end.
